I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the **Lovely School of Computer Science, Lovely Professional University**, for providing the necessary academic resources, technical infrastructure, and a supportive learning environment that made this project possible.

I am especially thankful to **Ms. Madhu Bala**, my faculty mentor, for her valuable guidance, continuous encouragement, and insightful feedback throughout the course of this project. Her support and direction played a significant role in shaping the analysis, dashboard design, and overall completion of the project.

I would also like to extend my appreciation to my friends and classmates for their cooperation, constructive discussions, and support during the data preprocessing, analysis, and **Power BI dashboard development** phases.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for their constant encouragement, patience, and moral support, which kept me motivated and focused throughout the successful completion of this project.
